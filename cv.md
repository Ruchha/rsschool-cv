## Briefly about myself:

I'm a student. After 2 years of studying in university as a programmer, I understood, that it can't give real knowledge to me, and to get a real job I need to do something by myself, thats why i joined RS School. Im trying to find myself in different spheres in programming and this is a good oppurtunity.
